Integrates Facebook Registration Tool into Wordpress registration/user system.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates the Facebook Registration Tool (http://developers.facebook.com/docs/user_registration) into Wordpress. For more information and support of this plugin, see: http://beyondwp.com/2010/12/21/facebook-registration-plugin-for-wordpress/

From beyondwp.com:

The Facebook Registration Tool, as announced by Facebook Developer Paul Tarjan (http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/440) provides a registration mechanism that is both Facebook user and Facebook hold-out friendly. Facebook Login (the tool formerly known as Facebook Connect) is a great solution to integrate Facebook into your site, but is not friendly to those users who donâ€™t have or utilize their own Facebook accounts. By utilizing this registration tool, Facebook can automatically complete the registration form for Facebook users while supplying a good-ole fashioned form for those not wanting or able to utilize Facebook to register.

== Installation ==

After installing plugin from Wordpress Repository (or extracting to /plugins directory), go to Settings > Facebook Registration and enter your Facebook App ID and App Secret. That's it!
